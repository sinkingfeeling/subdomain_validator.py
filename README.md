# subdomain_validator.py

This Python script generates a list of subdomains where is a known format such as us-001.domain.com through us-100.domain.com and then validates each subdomain by performing a DNS lookup to check if it resolves to a valid IP address. The validated subdomains are then written to an output file. This tool can be useful for generating a list of valid subdomains for use in security testing or other applications.
